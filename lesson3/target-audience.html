      again. He is hoping to find other community members who agree with his proposal, before he presents 
      it to the city council next month. He visits the site and is able to find the calendar of events 
      listing a luncheon for next week. 
    </p>

    <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
    <p>
      Bill Gubler is wants to increase revenue at his Cafe, but isn’t sure how to do so. He visits the site

      seminar on advertising and marketing and decides to attend. 
    </p>

    <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
    <p>
      Holly Wallace is busy planning a Christmas Raffle fundraiser for the local elementary school. She is 
      looking for a list of local businesses that she can contact who may be willing to donate goods for the 
      raffle. She visits the site and finds a list of businesses in the Directory. 
    </p>

      Holly Wallace wants to get the word out to as many people as she can that she is available to help with 
      their real estate needs. She isn't sure of the best way to do this. She visits the site to see what 
      options are available to her. She sees that there is a meet and greet luncheon coming up and decides to 
      go in hopes of networking. 
    </p>

    <h3>Scenario 5</h3>
    <p>
      Holly Wallace attended the meet and greet luncheon and was happy with her networking opportunity. She
